# Converting to a Chrome Extension

This guide explains how to convert this missing features tool into a Chrome extension that can be used with ChatGPT.

## Step 1: Build the application

First, build the application to generate static files:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the compiled JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files.

## Step 2: Create a manifest.json file

Create a `manifest.json` file in the `dist` folder with the following content:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "GPT Missing Features",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A floating MS Paint-style missing features tool for ChatGPT",
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://chat.openai.com/*"],
      "js": ["assets/index-*.js"],
      "css": ["assets/index-*.css"]
    }
  ],
  "permissions": ["clipboardWrite"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://chat.openai.com/*"]
}
```

## Step 3: Create icons for your extension

Create an `icons` folder in the `dist` directory and add icon files in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

You can use any image editing tool to create these icons.

## Step 4: Modify the build output paths (Optional)

You may need to update the Vite configuration to ensure that the built files have paths that will work with the extension structure:

In `vite.config.ts`, add:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: './',
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        entryFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].js',
        chunkFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].js',
        assetFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].[ext]'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Step 5: Update the manifest script paths

After building, you'll need to check the actual filenames in the `dist/assets` folder and update the `content_scripts` section in `manifest.json` to match the exact filenames generated by the build process.

For example, if the build process creates files named:
- `dist/assets/index-1a2b3c4d.js`
- `dist/assets/index-5e6f7g8h.css`

Update the manifest to:

```json
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["https://chat.openai.com/*"],
    "js": ["assets/index-1a2b3c4d.js"],
    "css": ["assets/index-5e6f7g8h.css"]
  }
]
```

## Step 6: Load the extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder
4. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

## Step 7: Test the extension

1. Navigate to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
2. The drawing tool should automatically appear on the page
3. Test all functionality to ensure it works correctly

## Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't work as expected:

1. Check the console for errors (right-click > Inspect > Console)
2. Ensure the manifest.json contains the correct file paths
3. Make sure the content script matches are correct for the URLs you're using
4. Verify that all permissions are correctly set

## Publishing to Chrome Web Store (Optional)

If you want to publish the extension:

1. Create a ZIP file of the `dist` directory
2. Create a developer account on the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/)
3. Pay the one-time developer registration fee
4. Create a new item and upload the ZIP file
5. Fill in all required information and submit for review

Note that the review process may take several days to complete.

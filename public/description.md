**GPT Power-Ups fixes ChatGPT’s em dash problem, cleans hidden Unicode, adds RTL support, and lets you sketch ideas directly in the chat – all in one lightweight Chrome extension.**

---

### 🚨 Why you need it

* **Remove em dashes from ChatGPT** – swaps — and – for a normal hyphen so your text never breaks forms, CMS fields, or code snippets.
* **Delete hidden Unicode** – wipes zero-width spaces, non-breaking spaces, smart quotes, ellipses, BOMs, joiners, and accent marks for copy-clean text.
* **Instant RTL layout** – flips any answer into right-to-left order for עברית, العربية, فارسی, اردو, and more.
* **Draw inside ChatGPT** – free-hand sketch, annotate screenshots, paste images, then send the graphic straight into your prompt.

### 🔑 Key Power-Ups

**1. Dash & Text Sanitizer**
Click “Sanitize” to clean the last assistant message:

* Fixes em and en dashes → hyphen
* Straightens curly quotes → straight quotes
* Converts … → ...
* Removes invisible and non-breaking characters
* Optional accent stripper (é → e)
  A counter shows how many fixes were applied. Copy once, paste anywhere.

**2. RTL Toggle**
One tap next to the “Share” icon flips the most recent response into correct right-to-left flow. Great for mixed English–Hebrew or English–Arabic output.

**3. GPT Paint**
Opens a floating canvas with brush, eraser, color picker, multiple brush sizes, image upload, clipboard paste, move tool, and PNG download. Hit “Send to ChatGPT” and the sketch becomes part of your conversation.
